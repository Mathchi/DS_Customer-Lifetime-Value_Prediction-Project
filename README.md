# What is the Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) ?

    The present value of the future cash flows attributed to the customer during his/her entire relationship with the company.

In marketing, CLTV, LCV, or LTV is a prognostication of the net profit contributed to the whole future relationship with a customer. The prediction model can have varying levels of sophistication and accuracy, ranging from a crude heuristic to the use of complex predictive analytics techniques.

Another definition about CLV, sometimes referred to as LTV, is the profit margin a company expects to earn over the entirety of their business relationship with the average customer.

The CLV value must account for CAC, ongoing sales and marketing expenses, operating expenses, and, of course, the cost required to manufacture the product and services the company is selling.

Many companies take a short-sighted approach by overlooking this valuable metric and instead optimize for a single sale in the near term. It’s still important to find new customers for the growth of the company, but optimizing the lifetime value of existing customers is also essential for a company to sustain a viable business model.

In fact, an increase in customer retention rates by only 5% has been found to increase profits anywhere from 25% to 95%. With this in mind, increasing the expected CLV is essential.

Note: I usually will use some abbreviated words below:

    Customer Lifetime Value — CLTV or CLV
    Lifetime Customer Value — LCV
    Life Time Value — LTV
    Customer Acquisition Costs — CAC
